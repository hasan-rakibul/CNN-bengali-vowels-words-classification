# Bengali Vowel Recognition
## Classification of nine Bengali vowels using a CNN
This repo contains the pre-defense preparation of my undergraduate thesis.

I didn't maintain this repo while I was doing my thesis, and that's why this is not so organized. To be honest, this repo is uploaded here in GitHub after three years. Apologies for this disorganization.
